    **All things arise from the earth**. They are nourished by the Earth. They live in the womb of the Earth. And all things return to the Earth


    Nothing is more sacred than Nature. Nothing is more pure than Nature. Those who befoul nature, are its enemies.


    They prepare their own necropolis. Because, when all human drama is over, **Nature will speak the last word**. And there will be no one to shed tears for the last man

    It was a special morning. The sun was brighter than usual. And the ocean was cooler. You offered me a glass to drink the ocean.


    How does one drink the ocean ? How does one drink waters of such vast oceans ?


    You had your bowl. There was no end. On and on we drank until the last drop. You looked at me and chanted: « Life is immortal ».


    The dry ocean smiled mourning its emptyness. The sun never set again.
